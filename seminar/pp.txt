Nowadays, many speech recognition system uses HMM to deal with variability in speech, this model can be outrun by CNN.CNN uses feed forward neural network and error rate reduction can be obtained. Deep neural networks (DNNs) that have many hidden layers and are trained using new methods have been shown to outperform GMMs on a variety of speech recognition benchmarks. In this seminar, we present a description of CNN and how it is used for speech recognition. Further, the design of CNN which includes pooling, connectivity and weight sharing is described. Experimental results show that the proposed CNN method can achieve over 10% relative error reduction in the core TIMIT test sets when comparing with HMM using the same number of hidden layers and weights.
