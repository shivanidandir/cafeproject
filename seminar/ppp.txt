The main concept in deep leaning algorithms is automating the extraction of representations (abstractions) from the data. Deep learning algorithms use a huge amount of unsupervised data to automatically extract complex representation. These algorithms are largely motivated by the field of artificial intelligence, which has the general goal of emulating the human brain’s ability to observe, analyze, learn, and make decisions, especially for extremely complex problems. 

Deep learning is in fact an important step toward artificial intelligence. It not only provides complex representations of data which are suitable for AI tasks but also makes the machines independent of human knowledge which is the ultimate goal of AI. 

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a type of advanced artificial neural network. It differs from regular neural networks in terms of the flow of signals between neurons. Typical neural networks pass signals along the input-output channel in a single direction, without allowing signals to loop back into the network. This is called a forward feed.

While forward feed networks were successfully employed for image and text recognition, it required all neurons to be connected, resulting in an overly-complex network structure.
