1.DNN is better than conventional model, as dnn can correlate in speech features.

2.further goes into CNN and state its advantages and how it is used.

3.Automatic speech recognition(ASR) is used for converting human speech to words.ASR needs to map variable-length signal into variable length sequence of words.

Here, HMM comes into action as it can handle variable length sequence.

GMM are used for estimating probabilistic distribution of speech signal associated with HMM states.


Recently, HMM use Artificial Neural Networks(ANN) are powerful discriminative models that can directly represent arbitrary classification surfaces in the feature space without any assumptions about the data’s structure.
